title: inter and intra job scheduling in distributed systems

- What are intra-job and inter-job scheduling 
	- Intra-job scheduling: Focuses on managing the execution order and allocation of resources within a single job to optimize performance and resource utilization. It deals with tasks or sub-tasks within the same computational job.
	- Inter-job scheduling: Involves coordinating the execution of multiple jobs or tasks across the distributed system. It prioritizes which job should run when and on which node or machine to balance the workload and optimize overall system performance and resource utilization.
