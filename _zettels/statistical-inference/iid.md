- Concept of Independence:
	- Each coin flip is independent of the others. The outcome of one flip (whether it's heads or tails) does not affect the outcome of any other flip. For instance, if you get heads on the first flip, it doesn't change the probability of getting heads on subsequent flips.
- Concept of Identically Distributed:
	- The coin is fair, meaning the probability of getting heads (or tails) remains the same for each flip. Specifically, each flip has a 50% chance of landing heads and a 50% chance of landing tails.
