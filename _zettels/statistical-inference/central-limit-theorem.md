title: central limit theorem
---
- Central Limit Theorem states sampling distribution of the sample mean (or sum) of a large number of independent, identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables approaches a normal distribution, regardless of the original distribution of the variables.
- Intuitively, if we were to take a group of people (sample population) at random and calculate the height; we'd observe the distribution tends towards [[normal distribution]] / gaussian distribution.
