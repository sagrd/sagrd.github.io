- **(Ideal) Amalgamation of two worlds**
	- world that makes money but needs traffic
	- world that has traffic but has no money

- **Feature Importance hierarchy:**[^1] 


	- **A gamechanger:** People will want to buy your product because of this feature.
	- **A showstopper:** People won’t buy your product if you’re missing this feature, but adding it won’t generate demand.
	- **A distraction:** This feature will make no measurable impact on adoption.
		
		Empirically, successful products have one to three gamechanging features, dozens of features that neutralize showstoppers, and very few features that are distractions.

		If you’re doing more showstopper features than you absolutely need to, you’re wasting resources.

		If you’re doing more than three gamechanging features, you’re wasting resources. Empirically, few disruptive products are good at a dozen things. Shipping gamechanging features is hard. Three is probably the most you can get away with, and even that is a stretch.

		Finally, if you don’t pour enough creative energy into any given gamechanging feature, you’re wasting resources.

- **On content (technical writing)** [^2]
	- The most effective strategy, in my experience, is to tap into a controversial point that your audience already holds and then back it up with data that you have to confirm their suspicions.
	- The second strategy is to share something uniquely helpful with your audience that makes them better at some meaningful aspect of their lives.
