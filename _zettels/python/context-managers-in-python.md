- Context Managers
   - Context managers help in resource management by properly allocating and releasing system resources. The `with` statement is a common way to implement context management.
   - Example:

```
with open("myfile.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("Hello World!")

# Using 'with' automatically closes the file after the block's execution.
```
