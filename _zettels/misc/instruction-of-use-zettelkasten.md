- cd in icloud drive
	- cd ~/Library/Mobile\ Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Documents/sagrd.github.io
- running locally
	- bundle exec jekyll serve 
	- and open your browser at `http://localhost:4000`

- Posts:
	- essays (renamed to interactive):
		- Ideally should only be multimedia (inc vidoes) and interactive
	- essays (showcase category on zettels):
		- for adding images in post `![spark session](../images/spark-output.png){:.ioda}`; The image has to be updated in root `images` folder.
		- Headings start with `##` and gradually move to `###` and `####` for subheadings
	- zettels:
		- zettels have no subheadings and cannot use `# headings`
		- tags:
			- `#article` for source and link
			- `#hide` for not displaying the post on the link (eg: zettels under sevenseas); zettels like this.
- Todo:
	- Whats on my mind ordering desc; category `showcase`
	- use properties: title instead of file-name-like-this. Use file name in link
	- catagory: `hide, show and showcase`: 
	- double check for private
	- properties `link and source` not displaying in post
