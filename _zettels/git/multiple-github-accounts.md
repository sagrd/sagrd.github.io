- Generate ssh keys `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your-email-address"`
- Enter file inÂ which to save the key (/home/vaati/.ssh/id_rsa): `/home/vaati/.ssh/id_rsa_work|`
- Open and copy the public key `cat .ssh/id_rsa_work.pub`
- Paste new `ssh-keys`  here: https://github.com/settings/keys; type should be `authentication-key` 
- As the key is saved with unique name, we'll need to run this command `ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa_work`
- Create a config file: `nano ~/.ssh/config`
```
