When designing data-intensive applications, itâ€™s crucial to define non-functional requirements alongside functional requirements. Non-functional requirements include attributes such as performance, reliability, availability, scalability, maintainability, security, and usability.
- Performance refers to the system's ability to respond to user requests within an acceptable time frame.
- Reliability is the system's ability to function correctly and consistently over time.
- Availability pertains to the system's readiness for correct service.
- Scalability is the capacity to handle increased workload or traffic without a performance drop.
- Maintainability involves the ease with which the system can be updated or modified.
- Security refers to the system's ability to protect against unauthorized access or attacks.
- Usability is about the ease with which users can interact with the system and accomplish their tasks.

These attributes are critical for the success of a data-intensive system and should be considered and prioritized from the outset.

## Achieving Reliability
Reliability is a cornerstone of data-intensive applications. It involves designing systems that operate correctly even in the presence of faults. There are several types of faults to consider, including hardware, software, and human errors.
### Fault Tolerance Techniques
- Replication: Creating multiple copies of data across different machines to ensure availability.
- Quorums: Using consensus protocols to ensure consistency among replicas.
- Redundancy: Adding extra components that can take over in case of failure.
- Isolation: Designing systems such that a fault in one component does not lead to a cascading failure.
- Versioning: Keeping track of different versions of data to ensure consistency and recovery capabilities.

Also CAP theorem, which states it is impossible for a distributed system to simultaneously provide consistency, availability, and partition tolerance. Understanding these trade-offs is crucial for designing reliable systems.

## Scalability Challenges
Scalability addresses the need to handle growing amounts of work or traffic. There are two main strategies for achieving scalability:
- Vertical Scaling: Enhancing a single machine's capacity by adding more resources.
- Horizontal Scaling: Distributing the workload across multiple machines, which can be more complex but also more powerful.

### Partitioning and Load Balancing
- Partitioning: Dividing a database into smaller, more manageable pieces. Techniques include range partitioning, hash partitioning, and list partitioning.
- Load Balancing: Distributing incoming requests evenly across servers to prevent any single server from becoming a bottleneck. Strategies include round-robin, least connections, and IP hash.
- Partitioning and load balancing play key roles in building scalable systems by ensuring data and requests are efficiently and effectively distributed.

## Ensuring Maintainability
Maintainability is crucial for the long-term success of data-intensive applications. It involves designing systems in a way that makes them easy to maintain, update, or modify. Following are some ideas for ensuring maintainability.
- Modularity: Breaking down the system into independent components that can be developed and maintained separately.
- Abstraction and Encapsulation: Hiding the complex internals behind simpler interfaces.
- Version Control: Using systems like Git to track changes and manage code versions.
- Testing and Debugging: Implementing comprehensive unit, integration, and system tests to catch and fix bugs early.
- Monitoring and Logging: Continuously monitoring the system's performance and logging data for debugging and analysis.

Understanding and addressing these non-functional requirements forms the bedrock of designing effective data-intensive applications that can scale, perform reliably, and remain maintainable in the long run.
